# Student Performance Dashboard in Tableau

## Overview

This project is a Tableau-based interactive dashboard that visualizes student performance data. The dashboard allows users to explore various aspects of student demographics, academic achievements, and performance metrics. The primary goal is to provide insights into factors affecting student performance, such as parental education levels, test preparation courses, and other demographics.

## Features

- **Interactive Filters**: Filter data by gender, parental level of education, test preparation course completion, and more.
- **Highlight Actions**: Highlights related data points to help identify trends and correlations.
- **Dynamic Visualizations**: Bar charts, pie charts, and scatter plots display various aspects of student performance.
- **User-Friendly Layout**: Easy-to-navigate design that adapts to different screen sizes.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Student Performance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/whenamancodes/students-performance-in-exams), which includes the following fields:

- `Gender`: The gender of the student.
- `Race/ethnicity`: Group categorization of the student.
- `Parental level of education`: The highest education level attained by the student's parents.
- `Lunch`: The type of lunch the student receives (standard or free/reduced).
- `Test preparation course`: Whether the student completed a test preparation course.
- `Math score`, `Reading score`, `Writing score`: The scores achieved in each subject.
